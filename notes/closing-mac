NOTE:

Well, it looks like this script has done its job. It is still under development and so I hope you will be able to read it and undo changes if things go wrong.

Keep in mind that tomcat might take a couple seconds to minutes to fully deploy openmrs. The OpenMRS wiki says that it would take up to 10 minutes or so.

This will open the window in Firefox. If you do not have firefox, navigate to the url "http://localhost:8080/openmrs"

Good luck!
