NOTE:

Well, it looks like this script has done its job. It is still under 
development and so I hope you will be able to read it and undo changes if things go wrong.
I have tested it multiple times and it has worked well on debian.

Keep in mind that tomcat might take a couple seconds to minutes to fully deploy openmrs. 
The OpenMRS wiki says that it would take upto 10 mintues or so. 
For me it took aobut 2 minutes but YMMV.

Good luck!
