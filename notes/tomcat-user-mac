WARNING:

Default user and password is admin
Change it before using tomcat and deploying OpenMRS for security (or after the script has run its course)

You can change it by doing so:
$ sudo vi /usr/local/Cellar/tomcat/*/libexec/conf/tomcat-users.xml
Locate the line which looks like
	<user name="admin" password="admin" roles="tomcat,admin,manager,manager-gui"/>
Change value of password to something secure
