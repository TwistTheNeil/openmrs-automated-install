NOTE:

The script is now going to attempt deploying OpenMRS. The application will be downloaded and extracted to 
	/var/lib/tomcat7/webapps/openmrs/
Effectively, this would deploy OpenMRS and you will be able to install it as usual using your browser at 
	YOUR_IP:8080/openmrs
If this doesn't look right to you, you may kill the script now using CTRL+C after you leave this message.

You may deploy OpenMRS yourself using your browser. Make sure that tomcat7 is running (sudo service tomcat7 start) 
without errors and then using your browser, go to
	YOUR_IP:8080/manager
Here, you will be able to locate the field where you may select the openmrs.war file and deploy it.

If you are on a CentOS system make sure to run initially the command below to set up a root password 
for the mariadb server
	mysql_secure_installation
